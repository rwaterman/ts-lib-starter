# Node10/ES2018 Typescript Lib Starter/Boilerplate
- A customized TS Lib Start Boilerplate TS library with
  - example directory structure (including proper output to a `lib`  directory with JS+source+maps+TS typings)
  - ESLint (not tied to tslint which is now deprecated)
  - Jest (no Jasmine)
  - Optimized configuration defaults for Node 10/ES2018.
  - All dev dependencies removed from `lib`
